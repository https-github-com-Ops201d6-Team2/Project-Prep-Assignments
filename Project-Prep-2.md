### Systems Selection

#### - Review the project guidelines and scenario. Meet as a team and decide what systems, platforms, or tools you’ll be using this project.
#### - Each should represent a clear, logical solution to a problem the client company is facing.
#### - Create a high-level list of systems, platforms, or tools you’ve decided to work with this project. For each, explain:
- How does it fit into your scenario’s requirements?
- What problem or pain point does it solve? In other words, what value does this add to your client?
  - Keep it high level without going into too much detail, 3-4 sentences is enough.
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
  - What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?
